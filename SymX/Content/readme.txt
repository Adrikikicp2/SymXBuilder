This is an experimental and buggy preview of the future merger of msdlurlgen and MassView (the MassView functionality is not in yet) that adds many new features, is far faster, and far more robust.

--Changes from msdlurlgen 2.6.0--
* Fully rewritten in C# and .NET 6.0
* Y2K38 compliance
* Multithreading! (over an order of magnitude faster)
* Logging!
* Different levels of verbosity!

Features coming in later alpha versions:
* MassView features!
* Downloading multiple files
* CSV input (read a csv, download all files) 
* Dump to URL and exit!
