SymX -start <start time> -end <end time> -filename <filename> -imagesize <image size> [options...]

Required switches:

-start [-s]: Start time to scan for (in decimal unix time format)
-end [-e]: End time to scan for (in decimal unix time format)
-filename [-f]: Filename to search for on symsrv
-imagesize [-i]: Imagesize to search for in hex format. Disregarded if -imagesizemin and -imagesizemax are both specified.

Optional switches:

-imagesizemin [-imin]: Minimum image size to search for in hex format.
-imagesizemax [-imax]: Maximum image size to search for in hex format.
-quiet [-q]: Quiet mode. Find nothing without making too much noise.
-verbose [-v]: Verbose mode. Find nothing going out in a blaze of glory!
-numdownloads [-threads, -t, -num]: Change the number of threads used for downloading. Range is 1-30 as this isn't DDOSX. Default is 12
-logtofile [-l, -log]: Log output to file. This respects verbosity.
-outfile [-out, -o]: If a file is found, rename it after download to the filename specified.
-generatecsv [-g]: Generate a CSV from URL list specified before downloading.
If -csvinfolder [-ci] and -outfile are specified, a list of ImageSizes and TimeDateStamps will be generated from a folder. Currently these are mandatory but they will soon be
optional.

NOT IMPLEMENTED SWITCHES in this alpha version:
-dontdownload [-d]: Generate list of URLs and exit, msdlurlgen 1.1 style!
-urloutfile [-u]: Output filename for list of URLs. 
-infile [-in]: Input to CSV-style list of URLs to try and download.

Feature suggestions welcome!
