Usage:
SymX -start <start time> -end <end time> -filename <filename> -imagesize <image size> [options...]
SymX -generatecsv -csvinfolder <folder> -outfile <filename>
SymX -infile <filename>

Required switches:

-start [-s]: Start time to scan for (in decimal unix time format)

-end [-e]: End time to scan for (in decimal unix time format)

-filename [-f]: Filename to search for on the Microsoft Symbol Server.

-imagesize [-i]: Imagesize to search for in hex format. Disregarded if the -imagesizemin and -imagesizemax options are both specified.

Optional switches:

-imagesizemin [-imin]: Minimum image size to search for in hex format. If both of these are set, the -imagesize option is disregarded.
Required if -imagesize is not provided.

-imagesizemax [-imax]: Maximum image size to search for in hex format. If both of these are set, the -imagesize option is disregarded. 
Required if -imagesize is not provided.

-quiet [-q]: Quiet mode. Find nothing without making too much noise.

-verbose [-v]: Verbose mode. Find nothing going out in a blaze of glory!

-numdownloads [-threads, -t, -num]: Change the number of threads used for downloading. A lower number of threads will reduce URL scanning performance. Range is 1-30, as this isn't DDOSX. The default value is 12.

-logtofile [-l, -log]: Log output to file. This respects -q and -v.

-outfile [-out, -o]: If a file is found, rename it after download to the filename specified.

-generatecsv [-g]: Generate a CSV containing image size and TimeDateStamp information from a folder, instead of downloading any files. If -generatecsv is specified, -csvinfolder [-ci] and -outfile are required options.
A list of ImageSizes and TimeDateStamps will be generated from the folder specified by -csvinfolder and dumped to the CSV file specified by -outfile.

-hextime [-h]: If this option is set, Start and End will be interpreted as hex format strings rather than as decimal Unix time format numbers.

-dontgeneratetempfile [-dt, -dtemp]: If this option is set, the temporary text file containing the successfully downloaded URLs will not be generated.

-infile [-in]: Input to a CSV file generated using -generatecsv to try and download.

-dontdownload [-d]: Generate list of URLs and exit, msdlurlgen 1.1 style!

-maxretries [-retries, -max, -m]: Number of times to retry downloading a file before giving up. Default is 8.

-useragentversion [-uaversion] and useragentvendor [-uavendor]: Override the user agent If you are downloading from a custom server that requires a specific useragent, this may be helpful.
Ignored if the default symbol server is specified.

-outfolder [-of]: Folder to output downloaded files to. Default is a "download" folder in the current working directory.

-symbolserverurl [-symsrvurl, -symsrv]: Alternative URL to try and acquire files from. Default is http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols. Must be a real symbol server.

-recursive [-recurse, -r]: Recursively scan a download folder for files to download.

-keepoldlogs [-keeplogs, -kl]: Do not automatically delete old log files.

-nologo: Don't print versioning information. Ignores verbosity.
