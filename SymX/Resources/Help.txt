Usage:
SymX -start <start time> -end <end time> -filename <filename> -imagesize <image size> [options...]
SymX -generatecsv -csvinfolder <folder> -outfile <filename>
SymX -infile <filename>

If no switches are provided, SymX will try to load settings from either Content\SymX.ini or the file specified by -inipath.

Required switches:

-start [-s]: Start time to scan for (in decimal unix time format)
-end [-e]: End time to scan for (in decimal unix time format)
-filename [-f]: Filename to search for on the Microsoft Symbol Server.
-imagesize [-i]: Imagesize to search for in hex format. DISREGARDED if the -imagesizemin and -imagesizemax options are BOTH specified.

Optional switches:

Output options:
-quiet [-q]: Quiet mode. Find nothing without making too much noise.
-verbose [-v]: Verbose mode. Find nothing going out in a blaze of glory!
-logtofile [-l, -log]: Log output to file. This respects -q and -v.
-outfile [-out, -o]: If a file is found, rename it after download to the filename specified.
-dontgeneratetempfile [-dt, -dtemp]: If this option is set, the temporary text file containing the successfully downloaded URLs will not be generated.

CSV generation options:

-generatecsv [-g]: Generate a CSV containing image size and TimeDateStamp information from a folder, instead of downloading any files. If -generatecsv is specified, -csvinfolder [-ci] and -outfile are required options.
A list of ImageSizes and TimeDateStamps will be generated from the folder specified by -csvinfolder and dumped to the CSV file specified by -outfile.
-infolder: Input folder to generate a CSV file from.
-recursive [-recurse, -r]: Recursively scan a download folder for files to download.

CSV download options:

-infile [-in]: Input to a CSV file generated using -generatecsv to try and download files from.

Searching and download options:

-imagesizemin [-imin]: Minimum image size to search for in hex format. If both of these are set, the -imagesize option is disregarded.
Required if -imagesize is not provided.
-imagesizemax [-imax]: Maximum image size to search for in hex format. If both of these are set, the -imagesize option is disregarded. 
Required if -imagesize is not provided.
-numthreads [-threads, -t]: Change the number of threads used for scanning. A lower number of threads will reduce URL scanning performance. Range is 1-30, as this isn't DDOSX. The default value is 12.
-numdownloads [=downloads, -nd]: Change the number of threads used for downloading. Default is -numthreads and the range is 1-15 due to performance concerns.
-hextime [-h]: If this option is set, Start and End will be interpreted as hex format strings rather than as decimal Unix time format numbers.
-dontdownload [-d]: Generate list of URLs and exit, msdlurlgen 1.1 style!
-maxretries [-retries, -max, -m]: Number of times to retry downloading a file before giving up. Default is 8.
-useragentversion [-uaversion] and useragentvendor [-uavendor]: Override the user agent. If you are downloading from a custom server that requires a specific useragent, this may be helpful.
Ignored if the default symbol server is specified.
-outfolder [-of]: Folder to output downloaded files to. Default is a "download" folder in the current working directory.
-symbolserverurl [-symsrvurl, -symsrv]: Alternative URL to try and acquire files from. Default is http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols, the Microsoft symbol server. 
Must be a real symbol server (such as http://symbolserver.unity3d.com/ or https://driver-symbols.nvidia.com).

Miscellaneous options:
-keepoldlogs [-keeplogs, -k]: Do not automatically delete old log files.
-nologo: Don't print versioning information before running. Ignores verbosity.
-inipath [-ini]: Load configuration options from a custom INI path instead of the default SymX.ini.
