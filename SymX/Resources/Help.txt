SymX -start <start time> -end <end time> -filename <filename> -imagesize <image size> [options...]

Required switches:

-start [-s]: Start time to scan for (in decimal unix time format)
-end [-e]: End time to scan for (in decimal unix time format)
-filename [-f]: Filename to search for on symsrv
-imagesize [-i]: Imagesize to search for in hex format. Disregarded if -imagesizemin and -imagesizemax are both specified.

Optional switches:

-imagesizemin [-imin]: Minimum image size to search for in hex format. If both of these are set, the -imagesize option is disregarded.
-imagesizemax [-imax]: Maximum image size to search for in hex format. If both of these are set, the -imagesize option is disregarded.
-quiet [-q]: Quiet mode. Find nothing without making too much noise.
-verbose [-v]: Verbose mode. Find nothing going out in a blaze of glory!
-numdownloads [-threads, -t, -num]: Change the number of threads used for downloading. A lower number of threads will reduce URL scanning performance. Range is 1-30, as this isn't DDOSX. The default value is 12.
-logtofile [-l, -log]: Log output to file. This respects verbosity.
-outfile [-out, -o]: If a file is found, rename it after download to the filename specified.
-generatecsv [-g]: Generate a CSV containing image size and TimeDateStamp information from a folder, instead of downloading any files.
If -csvinfolder [-ci] and -outfile are specified, a list of ImageSizes and TimeDateStamps will be generated from a folder. Currently these are mandatory but they will soon be optional.
-hextime [-h]: If this option is set, Start and End will be interpreted as hex format strings rather than as decimal Unix time format numbers.
-dontgeneratetempfile [-dt, -dtemp]: If this option is set, the temporary text file containing the 

NOT IMPLEMENTED SWITCHES in this alpha version:
-dontdownload [-d]: Generate list of URLs and exit, msdlurlgen 1.1 style!
-urloutfile [-u]: Output filename for list of URLs. 
-infile [-in]: Input to CSV-style list of URLs to try and download.

Feature suggestions welcome!
