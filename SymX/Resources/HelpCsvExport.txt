CSV export mode:
This mode generates a CSV file containing imagesizes, TimeDateStamps and URLs from a user-defined folder. 

Required switches:
-generatecsv [-g]: Generate a CSV containing image size and TimeDateStamp information from a folder, instead of downloading any files. If -generatecsv is specified, -csvinfolder [-ci] and -outfile are required options.
A list of ImageSizes and TimeDateStamps will be generated from the folder specified by -csvinfolder and dumped to the CSV file specified by -outfile.
-infolder: Input folder to generate a CSV file from.

Optional switches:
-recursive [-recurse, -r]: Recursively scan a download folder for files to download.
